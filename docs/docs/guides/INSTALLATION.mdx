## Installation & Requirements

Library supports react-native version 0.64+

Library supports Android & iOS, for out-of-tree platforms, `View` component is used as fallback.

```sh
yarn add react-native-avoid-softinput
```

On iOS run additionally

```sh
npx pod-install
```

:::info

Library on iOS uses Swift. Make sure that your project has bridging header configured (the easiest way is to create empty `.swift` file in XCode, which will offer to create bridging header).

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes when using this library you may find that your build fails due to incorrect `kotlinVersion` in your native project. To catch this you can do this depending on your configuration:

- **React Native project and Expo bare workflow**

you could modify `android/build.gradle` inside your android folder to specify your `kotlinVersion`

```java
buildscript {
    ext {
        kotlinVersion = "1.6.10"  // <-- add a version here for resolution
    }
}
```

- **Expo managed workflow**

Install `expo-build-properties`

```sh
npx expo install expo-build-properties
```

Add plugin inside of your app.json or app.config.js

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-build-properties",
        {
          "android": {
            "kotlinVersion": "1.6.10"
          }
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```
